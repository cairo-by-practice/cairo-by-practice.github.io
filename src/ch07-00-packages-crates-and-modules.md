## Packages, Crates and Modules

This chapter involves organizing code in large projects and introduces various techniques for managing code organization in Cairo. It emphasizes the need for grouping related functionality, separating code into modules and files, and creating external dependencies (crates) as a project grows. The chapter also covers the concept of encapsulating implementation details and the importance of scope in code organization. Cairo provides features such as Packages, Crates, Modules, and Paths to help manage code organization effectively.
